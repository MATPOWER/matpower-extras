function [E] = prim(Aadj)
%PRIM Prim's algorithm for calculating a minimal spanning tree.
%   [E] = PRIM(AADJ)
%   
%   Implementation of Prim's algorithm for calculating a minimal spanning
%   tree from a graph adjacency matrix. This implementation can incorporate
%   negative edge weights. Create a maximal spanning tree by specifying
%   the negative of the graph adjacency matrix.
%
%   Inputs:
%       AADJ : A graph adjacency matrix, including the possibility of
%           negative edge weights.
%
%   Outputs:
%       E : Matrix with two columns describing the resulting minimal weight
%           spanning tree. Each row gives the maximal cliques for a branch
%           of the tree.
