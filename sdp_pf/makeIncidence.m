function [Ainc] = makeIncidence(bus, branch)
%MAKEINCIDENCE   Builds the bus incidence matrix.
%   [Ainc] = MAKEINCIDENCE(MPC)
%   [Ainc] = MAKEINCIDENCE(BUS, BRANCH)
%
%   Builds the bus incidence matrix. This matrix has size nline by nbus,
%   with each row having two nonzero elements: +1 in the entry for the 
%   "from" bus of the corresponding line and -1 in the entry for the "to"
%   bus of the corresponding line.
%
%   Inputs:
%       MPC : MATPOWER case variable with internal indexing.
%
%   Outputs:
%       AINC : An nline by nbus size bus incidence matrix.
