function [cost] = combineCost(maxcliques,maxcliquesidx)
%COMBINECOST Calculate the cost of combining two maximal cliques.
%   [COST] = COMBINECOST(MAXCLIQUES,MAXCLIQUEIDX)
%
%   Calculate the cost of combining two maximal cliques in terms of the 
%   number of scalar variables and linking constraints that will be 
%   required after combining the maximal cliques specified in
%   maxcliquesidx. This is the clique combination heuristic described in
%   [1]. Negative costs indicate that the heuristic predicts
%   decreased computational costs after combining the specified maximal
%   cliques.
%
%   Inputs:
%       MAXCLIQUES : Cell array containing the buses contained in each
%           maximal clique.
%       MAXCLIQUESIDX : Vector of length two with elements corresponding to
%           the candidate maximal cliques.
%
%   Outputs:
%       COST : Scalar indicating the cost, as defined by the heuristic in
%       [1] of combining the specified maximal cliques.
