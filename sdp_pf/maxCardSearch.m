%MAXCARDSEARCH Determine graph chordality and maximal cliques.
%   [MAXCLIQUE,ISCHORDAL] = MAXCARDSEARCH(AADJ)
%
%   Determine the maximal cliques for a chordal graph described by the
%   adjacency matrix Aadj. Also test the graph for chordality. The
%   algorithms for determining the maximal cliques and testing for
%   chordality are described in [1].
%
%   Inputs:
%       AADJ : The adjacency matrix of a graph. If the graph is chordal,
%           the maximal cliques for this graph are calculated.
%
%   Outputs:
%       MAXCLIQUE : If the graph described by Aadj is chordal, maxclique
%           returns a matrix describing the maximal cliques of the graph.
%           Each column of maxclique represents a clique with nonzero
%           entries indicating the nodes included in the maximal clique. If
%           Aadj is not chordal, maxclique is set to NaN.
%       ISCHORDAL : Returns 1 if the graph described by Aadj is chordal,
%           otherwise returns 0.

%% Determine maximal cliques

% According to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chordal_graph
% "To list all maximal cliques of a chordal graph, simply find a perfect
% elimination ordering, form a clique for each vertex v together with the 
% neighbors of v that are later than v in the perfect elimination ordering,
% and test whether each of the resulting cliques is maximal."

% alpha is a candidate perfect elimination ordering. First form all
% cliques. Then determine which cliques are maximal. Put maximal cliques in
% the columns of the variable maxclique.

if ischordal
    % Form a matrix representation of the cliques
    clique = speye(nbus,nbus);
    for i=1:nbus
        % neighbors of node i that are later in the ordering
        neighbors = find(Aadj(i,:)); 
        neighbors = neighbors(alpha(neighbors) > alpha(i));

        clique(i,neighbors) = 1;
    end

    % Test whether each clique is maximal. A clique is not maximal if a node
    % neighboring any of the nodes in the clique, but not in the clique, is 
    % connected to all nodes in the clique.
    i=0;
    nclique = size(clique,1);
    while i < nclique
        i = i+1;

        neighbors = [];
        cliquei = find(clique(i,:));
        cliquei_bool = clique(i,:).';
        nnzi = sum(cliquei_bool);

        for k = 1:length(cliquei) % Check all nodes adjacent to nodes in the clique, but not included in the clique
            neighbors = [neighbors find(Aadj(cliquei(k),:))];
        end
        neighbors = unique(setdiff(neighbors,cliquei));

        not_maximal = 0;
        for m=1:length(neighbors)
            % If this neighbor is connected to all other nodes in the clique,
            % this is not a maximal clique
            if Aadj(neighbors(m),:) * cliquei_bool >= nnzi
                not_maximal = 1;
                break;
            end
        end

        if not_maximal
            clique = clique([1:i-1 i+1:nclique],:); % Delete this clique
            i = i-1; % After deletion, the next clique is really numbered i
            nclique = nclique - 1;
        end
    end
    maxclique = clique.'; % put maximal cliques in the columns
