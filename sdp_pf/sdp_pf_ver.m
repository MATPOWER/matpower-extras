function rv = sdp_pf_ver(varargin)
%SPD_PF_VER  Prints or returns SDP_PF version info for current installation.
%   V = SDP_PF_VER returns the current SDP_PF version number.
%   V = SDP_PF_VER('all') returns a struct with the fields Name, Version,
%   Release and Date (all strings). Calling SDP_PF_VER without assigning the
%   return value prints the version and release date of the current
%   installation of SDP_PF.
