function [QUANTITY, PRICE, FCOST, VCOST, SCOST, PENALTY] = idx_disp
%IDX_DISP   Defines constants for named column indices to dispatch matrix.
%   Example:
%
%   [QUANTITY, PRICE, FCOST, VCOST, SCOST, PENALTY] = idx_disp;
%
%   The index, name and meaning of each column of the dispatch matrix is given
%   below:
% 
%   columns 1-6
%    1  QUANTITY    quantity produced by generator in MW
%    2  PRICE       market price for power produced by generator in $/MWh
%    3  FCOST       fixed cost in $/MWh
%    4  VCOST       variable cost in $/MWh
%    5  SCOST       startup cost in $
%    6  PENALTY     penalty cost in $ (not used)
