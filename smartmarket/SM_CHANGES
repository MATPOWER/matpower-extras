Changes since MATPOWER 3.0b3
----------------------------

1/24/05
    - Switched to using isload() to check for dispatchable load.
	- Modified off2case.m to keep Q limits consistent with constant power
	  factor for dispatchable loads.

9/28/04
    - Modified to auction.m to clip cleared offer prices (but not bid prices)
      to max_p. Other changes to make it more robust for cases with
      very large bid/offer gap.
    
    - In smartmkt.m added conditionals to skip over code related to import
      gens (including offer and max_p adjustments) when there are no import
      generators. Fixed missing return args bug when OPF did not converge.


Changes since MATPOWER 3.0b2
----------------------------

9/15/04
    - Fixed bug in auction.m where locational prices were
      wiped out when generators had only a single block.

    - Fixed small bug in smartmkt.m related to single block
      generators, and worked around another related to handling
      of reserve generators when gencost and genoffer are
      not the same dimension.
      

Changes since MATPOWER 2.5b3
----------------------------

7/2/04
    - Fixed smartmarket.m to print correct prices even for decommitted
      gens

    - Fixed auction.m so that gens at Pmin are not able to set the price
      and each gen still gets a uniform price even if price is clipped by
      the offer/bid of a single block. Added lots of tests.

5/30/03
    - Added auction.m, removed everything to do with continuous
      offer/bid markets.

2/14/01
    - Corrected a comment.

4/3/00
    - Modified smartmkt.m so that reserve generators come in, not
      at the reservation price, but at $5 above the highest
      offer price (excluding offers above reservation price).

3/14/00
    - Made changes to off2case.m to fix problems with negative
      generation.
