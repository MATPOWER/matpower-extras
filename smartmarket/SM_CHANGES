Changes since MATPOWER 2.5b3
----------------------------

7/2/04
	- Fixed smartmarket.m to print correct prices even for decommitted
	  gens

	- Fixed auction.m so that gens at Pmin are not able to set the price
	  and each gen still gets a uniform price even if price is clipped by
	  the offer/bid of a single block. Added lots of tests.

5/30/03
	- Added auction.m, removed everything to do with continuous
	  offer/bid markets.

2/14/01
	- Corrected a comment.

4/3/00
    - Modified smartmkt.m so that reserve generators come in, not
	  at the reservation price, but at $5 above the highest
	  offer price (excluding offers above reservation price).

3/14/00
    - Made changes to off2case.m to fix problems with negative
      generation.
