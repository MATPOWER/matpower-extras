%           RUNMKT(CASEDATA, Q, P, MKT, MAX_P, U0, T, MPOPT, FNAME, SOLVEDCASE)
%
%   Computes a new generation schedule from a set of offers and bids,
%   where offers and bids are specified by Q and P, MKT tells it what
%   type of market to use, MAX_P is the price cap, U0 is a vector
%   containing the commitment status of each generator from the previous
%   period (for computing startup/shutdown costs), T is the time duration
%   of the dispatch period in hours, and MPOPT is a MATPOWER options vector
%   (see 'help mpoption' for details). Uses default options if MPOPT is not
%   given. The rows in Q and P correspond to the rows in gen and gencost,
%   and each column corresponds to another block in the marginal offer or
%   bid. The market codes are defined as the sum of the
%   following numbers:
%        1000                - all markets
%         100 * adjust4loc   - adjust4loc = 0 to ignore network,
%                              1 to compute locational adjustments via AC OPF,
%                              2 to compute them via DC OPF
%          10 * auction_type - where the values for auction_type are as follows:
%
%      0 - discriminative pricing (price equal to offer or bid)
%      1 - last accepted offer auction
%      2 - first rejected offer auction
%      3 - last accepted bid auction
%      4 - first rejected bid auction
%      5 - first price auction (marginal unit, offer or bid, sets the price)
%      6 - second price auction (if offer is marginal, then price is set
%                                   by min(FRO,LAB), if bid, then max(FRB,LAO)
%      7 - split the difference pricing (price set by last accepted offer & bid)
%      8 - LAO sets seller price, LAB sets buyer price
%
%   If P or Q are empty or not given, they are created from the generator
%   cost function. The default market code is 1150, where the marginal
%   block (offer or bid) sets the price. The default MAX_P is 500, the
%   default U0 is all ones (assume everything was running) and the default
%   duration T is 1 hour. The results may optionally be printed to a file
%   (appended if the file exists) whose name is given in FNAME (in addition
%   to printing to STDOUT). Optionally returns the final values of BASEMVA,
%   CQ, CP, BUS, GEN, GENCOST, BRANCH, F, DISPATCH, SUCCESS, and ET. If a
%   name is given in SOLVEDCASE, the solved case will be written to a case file
%   in MATPOWER format with the specified name with a '.m' extension added.
