function [baseMVA, bus, gen, branch, success, et, z, z_est, error_sqrsum] = run_se(casename, measure, idx, sigma, type_initialguess, V0)
%RUN_SE  Run state estimation.
%   [INPUT PARAMETERS]
%   measure: measurements
%   idx: measurement indices
%   sigma: measurement variances
%   [OUTPUT PARAMETERS]
%   z: Measurement Vector. In the order of PF, PT, PG, Va, QF, QT, QG, Vm (if
%   applicable), so it has ordered differently from original measurements
%   z_est: Estimated Vector. In the order of PF, PT, PG, Va, QF, QT, QG, Vm
%   (if applicable)
%   error_sqrsum: Weighted sum of error squares
